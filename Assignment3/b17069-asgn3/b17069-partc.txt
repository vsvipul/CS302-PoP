Parts A and B will be very difficult to merge as we could have a procedure parameter as both lazy and dynamic, or one of these or none of these. As we are just creating a list of dynamic vars in Part A and creating storing 2 envs in env, we'll keep doing the same. Implementing lazy over it will be similar to this but we'll have to separately check if the thunk we are creating should be of the (dynamic var) or just (var) and store the list of such dynamic lazy vars separately somewhere else.
